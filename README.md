# KAMPUS26: Study Plan for Autonomous Robotic Systems 2025-2026

## Overview

KAMPUS26 is a private "study in public" and research project that aims to learn about and share knowledge and insights about recent advances in decentralized robotics and swarm intelligence. The project is not affiliated with any organization or institution, but is inspired by the Distributed Autonomous Robotic Systems (DARS) Symposium series, which is a biennial forum for scientific exchange and technical communication on the latest advances in distributed robotics.

This self-study plan has two tracks: One will roughly follow the synopsis of papers presented at the 2023 DARS symposium and will involve reading and summarizing papers, writing blog posts and creating other materials that may be useful to the community, while the other will be more focused on implementing genetic algorithms in Elixir and using them to solve real-world problems.

The project will be conducted in the open, and all materials will be shared on GitHub.
