# 1. Your First Genetic Algorithm

## A Definition

A Genetic Algorithm is a class of optimization algorithms that is based on the evolution of a population of individuals (a.k.a. _particles_) driven by some form of selection, mutation and crossover.

### Particles

As an individual in a population, a particle is characterized by a (set of) data structures, that encode the external qualities of the particle.  
Inspired from biology, this data structure is called the _genotype_, while the external qualities are called the _phenotype_.

### Selection
